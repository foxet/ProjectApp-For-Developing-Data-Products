### Instructions:
- **ProjectApp** is a shiny application for Coursera Course Project of [Developing Data Products](https://class.coursera.org/devdataprod-011)
- Theis is also my first shiny application
- **ProjectApp** is use for exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG).
- **ProjectApp** is very simple, but I think it's good.
- The application has been host on shinyapps.io, [click here](https://foxet.shinyapps.io/ProjectApp/)
- More Information can be found at http://rpubs.com/foxet/60572

### Data:
- The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models)

### Examples:
- Go to my website: https://foxet.shinyapps.io/ProjectApp/
- you will see a panel on the left is for selecting predictors and make set some option. the plot on right side is showing the relationship between the MPG and selected predictor.
- Example: Choose one of the predictor, let's say 'Gross horsepower', and choose 'Add a smoothed condition mean', then click *"PLOT"*. now you can see the plot on the right look just as the plot below:

- You can also explore the relationship between MPG and 'Gross horsepower' by different "Number of cylinders. 
- just select variable on 'Factor panel' now you can the plot as follow:
